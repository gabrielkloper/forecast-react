# Forecast Weather

This is a simple React application that displays the current weather and 5-day forecast for a given city.

It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the data and displays it in a simple and easy-to-read format.

I built this application to learn about the following topics:

- React Hooks: I used useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and fetch data from the API.
- React Components: I created different components for displaying the current weather and the 5-day forecast.
- React Context API: I used the Context API to share the data between different components.
- React Router: I used React Router to create a simple navigation between different pages.
- CSS Grid: I used CSS Grid to create a responsive layout for the application.
- CSS Variables: I used CSS Variables to manage the colors and layout of the application.
- ESLint and Prettier: I used ESLint and Prettier to manage the code quality and formatting.
- Vite: I used Vite as the development server and build tool.
- API: I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the data.

I also learned about the importance of accessibility and how to make the application more accessible.
